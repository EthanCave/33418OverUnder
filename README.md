# Left Side Auton
The Left Side Auton uses a PID Controller to score the preload, remove the initial triball from the match load area, and touch the same color elevation bar.
# Right Side Auton
The Right Side Auton does the exact same thing, but on the right side.
# Auton Skills
Auton Skills uses odometry to do the following tasks:
1. Score the Preload
2. Launch all match loads to the other side
3. Use FlapJack to score the triballs in front of the other side goal
4. Move around the net and score triballs from different angles.
5. Elevate

# Driver Control
The driver control allows control of the flapjack, control of the catapult, and basic arcade drive.

# JAR Template
This program currently uses JAR Template. I am not trying to write this code off as my own. JAR Template has been super usefull to be able to see what PID controllers and Odometry are capable of, but in the future, I would like to move away from JAR template and start working on my own PID and Odometry Code. Thank you 2775 for the template.
